- 👋 Hi, I’m @NDELEON169
- 👀 I would like to comment on your CAP LOCK INDICATOR application.
- 🌱 I'm just a user, I don't write codes.
- 💞️ Looking for possibility to implement application improvements.
- 📫 You can reach me at my contact information ask the sysop..
I would like your onscreen **CAP LOCK INDICATOR** application to create separate boxes for **CAPS LOCKS**, **NUM LOCK** and **SCROLL LOCK**.
I've noticed that they all go disappear from the screen once any of them is disabled.  This will keep the others displayed on the
the screen because they have not been disabled.  I think this would be a great improvement to the already nice 3rd party application.
Thank you very much.
